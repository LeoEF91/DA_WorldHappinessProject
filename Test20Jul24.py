    To predict the happiness scores of countries, six feature variables were selected.
    
    **Target Variable:**
    
    **Ladder score:** Happiness score representing subjective well-being. It is the national average response by individuals in a country to the question of own quality of life which they were able to rate along a ladder ranging from 0 to 10.
    """)
    
    st.write("""
    ### Feature Variables:
    
    **1. Logged GDP per capita:** GDP per capita is a measure of the economic output per person in a specific geographical area, usually a country.
    
    **2. Social support:** This variable represents an opinion of individuals about their own situation regarding how much they can rely onto social support (e.g., family, friends) in challenging situations. The Social Support value can vary between 0 and 1 and it's a national average of all individuals based on binary responses (0 or 1).
    
    **3. Healthy life expectancy:** This variable represents healthy life expectancies at birth, based on data from the WHO and original data.
    
    **4. Freedom to make life choices:** This variable represents the national average of responses to the question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”. Values can vary between 0 and 1.
    
    **5. Generosity:** This variable represents a quantification of how much more or less generous a country’s population is compared to what is expected when considering the country's GDP per capita. A negative value indicates that the country's population seems to have a less generous donation behavior than what the GDP per capita variable would predict.
    
    **6. Perceptions of corruption:** This variable indicates the national average perception of whether corruption is widespread throughout the government and within businesses. As the responses for the two questions used for this indicator are binary, the values of this variable can only range between 0 and 1.

After studying all dimensions and measurements thoroughly included in the data frames and conducting basic pre-processing steps, we kept on familiarising ourselves with the data through visualisation graphs.

First, the team focused on the year 2021 being the most recent year in the given date range, but also because it offered some additional information, for example the Regional Indicator.

To have a first impression of how the ladder score value is distributed across countries in 2021, the project team computed a map showing the geographical distribution of the happiness scores using the Plotly express library (below). This library allows plotting a world map using the px.choropleth in which the countries covered by the dataset (149 countries) are coloured based on the ladder score value. Benefitting from Plotly’s interactive feature, by hovering your mouse over the countries, you can see their name and ladder score value.

The very dark blue and dark red colours - representing the maximum and the minimum ladder score values - seem to be associated with only a few countries.

Additionally, we can observe the grouping of countries by region, certain neighbouring country groups being in the same range of the Ladder score. 

The column Regional Indicator was only present in the 2021 data frame, and to answer our assumption, if the Region could be an indicator of the range in the Ladder score, we created a graph displaying its distribution by Region, with boxplots: 
Regions graph.

Meanwhile the temporal factor was not our main focus in the project, it’s interesting to see how this value changes over time in the world, but to understand the underlying issues resulting in this evolution requires a deeper analysis. 

Next, our team studied correlations between the main variables for the whole time frame 2005-2021, namely: Ladder score, Social support, Logged GDP per capita, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity and Perceptions of corruption. 

Scatterplots offer a great visual representation of correlations. Choose any variables you would like to see in combination with the Ladder score in the next graph:

There are strong positive correlations between variables such as GDP per capita, Social support, Life expectancy and the Ladder score. This suggests that countries with higher GDP per capita, stronger social support systems, and longer life expectancies tend to have higher happiness scores. A Pearson test also statistically confirmed the positive correlations of the Ladder score with GDP per capita and Healthy life expectancy.

On the other hand, the Perception of corruption negatively correlates with the Ladder score. 

Finally, we identified the five happiest and least happy countries over the entire time frame 2005-2021 by computing the average ladder score per country:

    Furthermore, the dataset was reduced to the minimum – meaning, only the feature and the target variables were kept and rows where more than two missing values of the feature variables are missing (i.e., at least 33% of the explanatory data missing) were deleted.

To this end, the project team produced two different merged data set versions – one for visualization purposes, the other for machine modelling usage. For the latter, best practice was followed by imputing missing data only after splitting the data set into a train and a test set.
    
    **- Data imputation for visualization:** Imputation was carried out by substituting the missing data with the median of each respective column.
    
    **- Data imputation for machine modelling:** Imputation was carried out by substituting the missing numerical variable values with the median value of each country. In the case where no country values existed for the variable of interest, the median of the column (vs. the median of the country) was taken. For machine modelling the project team wanted to replace data in a way representative as much as possible for a country. Therefore, this approach was chosen over taking the median of each column.

    Given our feature variables have different ranges, it is advisable to carry out normalization or standardization on those variables. As most values in the columns do not follow a normal distribution, the project team decided against standardization, which is suggested in case of normal distribution. Instead, normalization was carried out on the six feature variables using the Min-Max-Scaler. This choice was made despite the presence of values on the upper and lower extreme. Min-Max-Scaler, as opposed to e.g., robust scaler, is sensitive to outliers but these values represent extreme values (vs. outliers) and therefore should be considered as part of the representative range.

    Different performance metrics suitable for regression type problems were calculated to inform the selection of the most appropriate model: the scores (R2), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Cross Validation Score.

Taking a closer look at the five happiest countries, we can see that four out of five countries were predicted correctly to be in the top five. 
Yet, only two out of four were predicted correctly in terms of the ranking position (i.e. index) - which are Finland as happiest country and Denmark as third happiest country.

Regarding the five least happy countries, our predictions turn out to be less reliable, considering that only two countries, namely Afghanistan and Sierra Leone were predicted correctly to be in the five least happy countries. 

Note that the model was not intended to predict the right ranking but to calculate the expected happiness scores, however, the prediction of the five happiest and least happy countries, - which was our main project goal, - derives from the approach trying to create a more practical interpretation of the data

The World Happiness Report is one of, if not the most well known happiness research, and our team could learn a lot about how happiness is measured, which factors are taken into consideration as influential factors and from a statistical point of view, how each of these factors contribute to the overall results. 

We gained valuable insights along the way during data exploration, visualisation and statistical methods.

The analysis we conducted and the machine learning project provided us with the results we hoped for, getting predictions for the happiness score for 2022 and 5-5 country names representing the happiest and least happy countries. 

Overall, we can conclude that the predictions on the top five happiest countries were better than for the five least happy countries. Yet, with only six correctly predicted countries out of 10 (i.e. 60%), and with only two countries predicted correctly in terms of rating positions out of ten (i.e. 20%), the results are not as satisfying as expected. 

The project team would advise to investigate whether optimising other models, such as Linear Model or Decision Tree Regressor, would lead to better results.
